The required analysis for the management to get an understanding on the performance of baseball players based on their positions like outfielder, infielder, and catcher. To get a clear image on the player’s statistics by conducting ANOVA analysis and a regression analysis to see the impact on On-Base percentage (OBP) in regards with Average (AVG), Slugging percentage (SLG) and On Base plus Slugging percentage (OPS).

We can reject the null hypothesis, as we obtained the p-value of 0.048 from ANOVA analysis which indicates that there is a significant difference in on-base percentage (OBP) among outfielders, infielders, and catchers. This proves that player position plays a key influence on OBP in baseball.

As per the regression analysis, we obtained p-value for SLG and OPS as 0.00, which indicates that there is a significant impact on OBP which p-value of AVG was 0.765, suggesting that AVG is not a significant indicator for OBP. 

In conclusion, the player performance changes based on the position they are on the field. SLG and OPS have a significant impact on OBP of the players.
